## Example: Accidents by state (via SQL Query)
Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

You can use SQL to query data directly from the app, including query parameters. This increased flexibility makes CARTO a great solution to build geospatial applications.

CARTO platform allows you to upload a [raster](https://docs.carto.com/data-and-analysis/analytics-toolbox-for-bigquery/sql-reference/raster) and visualize it in deck.gl using the RasterLayer.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/CartoDB/deck.gl-examples/tree/master/raster-temperature?file=index.ts)

Or run it locally:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:
* `npm dev` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
* `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
