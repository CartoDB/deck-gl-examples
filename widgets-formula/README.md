## Example: Formula widget

A simple example that showcases how to build a scalable [Formula widget](http://todo.com) using CARTO + deck.gl that stays synchronized with the map, using large-scale data coming from the same cloud data warehouse as your maps.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and serve files.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/CartoDB/deck.gl-examples/tree/master/dynamic-tiling-pois?file=index.ts)

Or run it locally:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:

- `npm run dev` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
- `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.
